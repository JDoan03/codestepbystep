# Write a function named num_in_common that accepts two lists of integers as
# parameters and returns the count of how many unique integers occur in both
# lists. For example, if two lists named l1 and l2 contains the values
# [3, 7, 3, -1, 2, 3, 7, 2, 15, 15] and [-5, 15, 2, -1, 7, 15, 36]
# respectively, your function should return 4 because the elements -1, 2, 7,
# and 15 occur in both lists. Use one or more sets as storage to help you
# solve this problem. Do not modify the lists passed in.
